# Robofriends
Robofriends is a web page that uses a very fun way to display data. 

## What have I learned in this project: 
* Implentation of  [`create-react-app`](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) 
* MVC architecture
* Communicate with [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) to retrieve data. 
* Implementation of [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/) as a CSS toolkit

## Technologies I used: 
* React 
* React DOM 
* Tachyons

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.




This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
